# music_collection_pipeline

One day I so fucked up when finally found good-for-mood song changed once again to fucking unsuitable one! And sometimes your library is so huge that you can't fastly say which one is good for the next in your shuffle list. And why you must do this by your own?

So I decided to do something. I've done music clusterization - and got some results!! God, it was fucking lol.

Someday I'll do something good here, but not today.
